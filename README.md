FMS, or Football Manager Simulator, is an academic project developt by Lourenço Neto and Leo Lobo for 
CES-22 (Oriented Object Programming) subject at Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronaútica (ITA).

Inspired by simulators where the users can experience how is like to be a manager from a soccer team, such as Brasfoot and Football Manager,
this project's group will be made with the same idea: The user don't play with the players, only will be in the role of the manager: 
Hiring new members for the team; Scaling the players for each game, with data from real teams (The database is from FIFA 2018 game); Selling or renting players; etc.

It will be used the Python language, with the help of the PyGame and Pandas packages, to build each game window and its interaction with the user and the database.
